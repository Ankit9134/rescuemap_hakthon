    <h1>Forest Fire Precautions and Safety: Be Prepared, Be Aware</h1>
    <h2>Before a Forest Fire:</h2>

<h4><ul><li>Informed: Closely monitor fire danger ratings and weather forecasts issued by official sources. Sign up for emergency alerts in your area.</li>
<li>Create a Defensible Space: Clear flammable vegetation like leaves, dead branches, and debris around your home for at least 30 feet (10 meters). This creates a barrier that can slow the spread of fire.</li>
<li>Prepare an Emergency Kit: Assemble a kit with non-perishable food, water, first-aid supplies, medications, flashlights, batteries, a battery-powered radio, sanitation supplies, and important documents. Consider including a respirator or mask for smoke inhalation.</li>
<li>Develop an Evacuation Plan: Discuss escape routes with your family and practice them regularly. Identify a designated meeting place outside the fire zone.</li></ul></h4>
<h2>During a Forest Fire:</h2>

<h4><ul><li>if Instructed: Don't hesitate if authorities order an evacuation. Don't risk getting trapped by flames or smoke. Follow designated evacuation routes and avoid congested areas.</li>
<li>Follow Instructions: Pay close attention to instructions from emergency personnel. They will provide updates on the fire situation and evacuation procedures.</li>
<li>If Trapped Indoors: Close all windows and doors to keep smoke out. Seal cracks around doors and windows with wet towels or cloths. Shelter in a room on the interior of the house, preferably a basement. Stay low to the ground and cover your mouth and nose with a damp cloth.</li></ul></h4>
<h2>After a Forest Fire:</h2>

<h4><ul><li>Stay Away from the Area: Wait for official clearance before returning to the fire zone. Areas may still be smoldering and pose dangers like falling trees or unstable structures.</li>
<li>Report Damage: Contact local authorities to report any damage to your property.</li>
<li>Be Aware of Air Quality: Smoke and ash from wildfires can irritate your lungs. Wear a mask if you are outdoors and experiencing respiratory discomfort.</li></ul></h4>
<h2>Additional Tips:</h2>

<h4><ul><li>Campfire Safety: If you have a campfire, build it in a designated fire pit and extinguish it completely before leaving the area. Drown the fire with water and stir the ashes to ensure no embers remain.</li>
<li>Cigarette Disposal: Never discard cigarettes on dry ground or from a moving vehicle. Extinguish cigarettes properly in a designated ashtray.</li>
<li> Spark Aware: Avoid using machinery or equipment that could generate sparks in dry, flammable areas.</li></ul></h4>
