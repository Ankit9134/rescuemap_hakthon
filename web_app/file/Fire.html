    <div><h1>Fire Precautions and Safety: Be Prepared, Be Aware</h1>
        <h2>Prevention:</h2>
        <h4><ul><li>Smoke Alarms: Install smoke alarms on every level of your home, inside and outside sleeping areas. Test them monthly and replace batteries regularly.</li>
       <li> Cooking Safety: Stay focused while cooking. Keep flammable objects away from the stovetop and oven. Clean cooking surfaces regularly to avoid grease buildup.</li>
       <li> Electrical Safety: Avoid overloading outlets. Don't run electrical cords under rugs or furniture. Have a qualified electrician fix any damaged wiring.</li>
        <li>Heating Sources: Maintain heating appliances and have them serviced regularly. Keep space heaters away from furniture and flammable materials.</li></ul></h4>
       <h2> Escape Planning:</h2>
       <h4><ul><li>Plan and Practice: Develop a fire escape plan with your family and practice it twice a year. Discuss two escape routes from each room in case one is blocked.</li>
        <li>Clear Exits: Ensure all exits are clear and easy to open from the inside. Don't block exits with furniture or clutter.</li>
       <li> Meeting Place: Designate a meeting place outside your home where everyone will gather after escaping a fire.</li></ul></h4>
        <h2>In Case of Fire:</h2>
       <h4><ul><li>GET OUT. STAY OUT. CALL FOR HELP: This is the most important rule. Evacuate immediately when the fire alarm sounds or you smell smoke. Don't waste time trying to save belongings.</li>
       <li>Feel the Door: Before opening a door, feel it with the back of your hand. If it's hot, don't open it. Use your alternative escape route.</li>
        <li>>Stay Low: Smoke and heat rise. Crawl low to the ground to avoid breathing in smoke.</li>
        <li>Call 911 (or your local emergency number): Once you are safely outside, call emergency services from a neighbor's phone or a cell phone.</li></ul></h4>
