<h1>Earthquake Precautions and Safety: Be Prepared, Be Aware</h1>
	<h2>Before an Earthquake:</h2>

<h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Assemble an Emergency Kit: Prepare a backpack or designated area with essential supplies like water, non-perishable food, first-aid kit, flashlight, batteries, radio, and important documents.</li>
<li>Earthquake Plan: Discuss and practice an earthquake plan with your family. Decide on meeting locations after an earthquake and designate a safe spot indoors (Drop, Cover, Hold on) and outdoors (open area away from buildings).</li>
<li>Hazard Mitigation: Secure furniture, cabinets, and shelves to walls to prevent them from falling during tremors. Identify and fix potential hazards around your house like loose wires or heavy picture frames.</li></ul></h4>
<h2>During an Earthquake:</h2>
<h4><ul><li>Drop, Cover, and Hold On: If indoors, immediately drop to the ground, take cover under a sturdy table or desk, and hold on until the shaking stops. Avoid windows, doors, and hanging objects.</li>
<li>Stay Indoors (if possible): If you're indoors during an earthquake, the safest place is generally under a sturdy piece of furniture. Only evacuate if there's a fire or immediate danger of building collapse.</li>
<li>Outdoors: If outdoors, move to a clear open area away from buildings, trees, power lines, and other hazards.</li></ul></h4>
<h2>After an Earthquake:</h2>
<h4><ul><li>Check for Injuries: Check yourself and others for injuries and provide first aid if needed.</li>
<li>Expect Aftershocks: Be prepared for aftershocks, smaller earthquakes that can follow the main one.</li>
<li>Listen to Authorities: Stay informed by listening to the radio or following instructions from local authorities.</li>
<li>Check for Damage: Carefully inspect your surroundings for structural damage, gas leaks, or fire hazards.</li>
<li>Evacuate if Necessary: If authorities recommend evacuation, follow their instructions and proceed calmly to the designated areas.</li></ul></h4>
