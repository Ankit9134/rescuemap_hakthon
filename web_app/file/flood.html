       <h2> Before a Flood:</h2>
<h4><ul><li> Informed: Monitor weather reports and flood warnings issued by official sources. Sign up for emergency alerts in your area.</li>
<li>Know Your Flood Risk: Identify if your property is in a flood plain. Research historical flood levels in your area.</li>
<li>Flood Proofing: Consider measures like elevating utilities, installing flood barriers, or sealing crawl spaces (if applicable) to minimize flood damage.</li>
<li>Prepare Your Home: Secure loose objects outside that could become projectiles in floodwaters. Move important belongings to higher levels.</li></ul></h4>
<h2>During a Flood:</h2>
<h4><ul><li>Evacuate if Instructed: Don't hesitate if authorities order an evacuation. Don't risk getting trapped by floodwaters.</li>
<li>Move to Higher Ground: If evacuation is not possible, move to the highest level of your home and stay away from windows and doors.</li>
<li>Turn Off Utilities: If safe to do so, turn off electricity and gas at the main valves to prevent fires and hazards.</li>
<li>Stay Informed: Use a battery-powered radio for the latest weather updates and instructions from emergency services.</li></ul></h4>
<h2>After a Flood:</h2>
<h4><ul><li>Stay Indoors: Wait for an official "all-clear" before venturing outside. Floodwaters may be contaminated or hiding debris.</li>
<li>Beware of Hazards: Watch out for downed power lines, damaged buildings, and contaminated water.</li>
<li>Inspect Your Home: Be cautious when entering your home. Look for structural damage, electrical hazards, and gas leaks.</li>
<li>Document Damage: Take photos and videos of flood damage to your property for insurance purposes.</li></ul></h4>
