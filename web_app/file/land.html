    <div><h1>Landslide Precautions and Safety: Be Prepared, Be Aware</h1>
       <h2> Before a Landslide:</h2>

<h4><ul><li>Know Your Risk: Identify if your property is in a landslide-prone area. Research historical landslide events in your locality.</li>
<li>Recognize Warning Signs: Be aware of potential triggers like heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt, or changes in water flow around your property. Look for cracks in foundation walls, unusual tilting of trees, or unusual water flow near slopes.</li>
<li>Maintain Drainage: Clear clogged ditches and gutters around your home to ensure proper water drainage away from foundation walls.</li>
<li>Develop an Evacuation Plan: Discuss escape routes with your family and practice them regularly. Identify a designated meeting place outside the landslide hazard zone.</li>
<li>Prepare an Emergency Kit: Assemble a kit with non-perishable food, water, first-aid supplies, medications, flashlights, batteries, a battery-powered radio, sanitation supplies, and important documents.</li></ul></h4>
<h2>During a Landslide:</h2>

<h4><ul><li>Listen for Warning Sounds: Be aware of unusual sounds like cracking or loud booms that might indicate a landslide starting.</li>
<li>Evacuate Immediately: If you see cracks in the ground, unusual water flow, or other warning signs, evacuate your home immediately and move to higher ground following your pre-determined escape route. Don't waste time trying to save belongings.</li>
<li>Follow Instructions: Pay attention to instructions from emergency personnel and stay away from the landslide area.</li></ul></h4>
<h2>After a Landslide:</h2>

<h4><ul><li>Stay Away from the Landslide Area: The area could be unstable and prone to further landslides. Wait for official clearance before returning home.</li>
<li>Report Damage: Contact local authorities to report any damage to your property or infrastructure.</li>
<li> Your Home: Be cautious when entering your home. Look for structural damage, gas leaks, and downed power lines. Don't turn on lights or appliances if you suspect a gas leak.</li></ul></h4>
