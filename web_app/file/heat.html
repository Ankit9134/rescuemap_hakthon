    <div><h1> Heat Wave Precautions and Safety: Be Prepared, Be Aware</h1>
    <h2>Stay Hydrated:<h2>

<h4><ul><li> plenty of water throughout the day, even if you don't feel thirsty. Aim for cool water or rehydration drinks like buttermilk (lassi) or homemade lemonade (nimbu pani).</li>
<li>Avoid sugary drinks, excessive caffeine, and alcohol, as they dehydrate you.</li>
<li> a water bottle with you whenever you go outside.</li></ul></h4>
<h2>Beat the Heat:</h2>

<h4><ul><li>outdoor activity: Avoid strenuous exercise or work during the hottest part of the day, typically between 12 noon and 3 PM.</li>
<li>Seek air conditioning or cooling shelters: If possible, spend time in air-conditioned spaces like libraries, malls, or designated cooling centers.</li>
<li>Take cool showers or baths: This can help lower your body temperature quickly.</li></ul></h4>
<h2>Prepare Your Home:</h2>
<h4><ul><li>windows and doors closed during the hottest part of the day. Open them at night for cooler air circulation.</li>
<li>Use curtains, blinds, or sunshades on windows facing the sun. This helps block heat from entering your home.</li>
<li>If you don't have air conditioning, use fans and traditional cooling methods like keeping wet mats or cloths on doors and windows.</li></ul></h4>
<h2>Look Out for Others:</h2>

<h4><ul><li>Never leave children or pets unattended in parked vehicles. Even with windows cracked open, the temperature inside a car can rise rapidly to dangerous levels.</li>
<li>Check on vulnerable individuals: Especially elderly people living alone who may be more susceptible to heatstroke. Offer them water or help them stay cool.</li>
<h3><ul><li> Aware of Heatstroke Symptoms:</li>
<li>High body temperature (above 104Â°F)</li>
<li>Confusion, dizziness, or headache</li>
<li>Rapid, shallow breathing</li>
<li>Feeling faint or weak</li>
<li>Nausea or vomiting</li></ul></h3>
</ul>
