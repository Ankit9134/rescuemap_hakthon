    <div><h1>Chemical Leakage Precautions and Safety: Be Prepared, Be Aware</h1>
        <h2>Immediate Actions:</h2>

        <h4><ul><li> Evacuate or Shelter-in-Place: The first step depends on the severity of the leak and the type of chemical involved. If you are unsure, evacuate the area immediately.</li>
        <li>Follow Instructions: Listen for announcements from emergency personnel or facility management. They will advise on evacuation routes or shelter-in-place procedures.</li>
       <li> Identify the Chemical: If possible and safe to do so, try to identify the leaking chemical from warning labels or placards. This information will help emergency responders assess the situation.</li></ul></h4>
        
       <h2> Shelter-in-Place:</h2>
        
        <h4><ul><li>Seal Doors and Windows: If instructed to shelter-in-place, close all doors and windows to prevent further contamination.</li>
        <li>Turn Off Ventilation: Shut down any ventilation systems like air conditioners or fans.</li>
        <li>Go to an Upper Floor: If possible, move to the highest level of the building as some chemicals tend to sink.</li></ul></h4>
        <h2>General Safety Measures:</h2>
        
        <h4><ul><li>Do Not Touch the Leak: Avoid any direct contact with the leaking chemical or contaminated surfaces.</li>
       <li> Do Not Breathe Fumes: Avoid inhaling fumes from the leak. If you experience coughing, dizziness, or difficulty breathing, move to fresh air immediately and seek medical attention.</li>
        <li>Remove Contaminated Clothing: If your clothes come into contact with the chemical, remove them carefully outdoors and avoid touching your skin.</li></ul></h4>
       <h2> After the Leak:</h2>
        
       <h4><ul><li> Wait for Clearance: Do not re-enter the area until emergency personnel declare it safe. They will assess the situation and ensure proper decontamination procedures are followed.</li>
        <li>Seek Medical Attention: If you experience any symptoms of exposure, such as skin irritation, respiratory problems, or nausea, seek medical attention immediately.</li>
        <li>Follow Decontamination Instructions: Emergency personnel will provide instructions on how to decontaminate yourself and your belongings if necessary.</li></ul></h4>
        <h2>Prevention:</h2>
        
        <h4><ul><li>Storage: Chemicals should be stored properly in designated areas with adequate ventilation.</li>
       <li> Regular Inspections: Facilities that handle chemicals should have regular inspections to identify and address potential leaks.</li>
        <li>Employee Training: Employees who work with chemicals should receive proper training on safe handling procedures and emergency response protocols.</li></ul></h4>
