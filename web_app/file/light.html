        <h1>Linghting Precautions and Safety: Be Prepared, Be Aware</h1>
   <h2> When Outdoors:</h2>
<h4><ul><li>Shelter Immediately: If you hear thunder or see lightning, find safe shelter promptly. The best options are substantial buildings or enclosed, metal-roofed vehicles with the windows rolled up. Avoid open structures like gazebos or bus stops.</li>
<li>Stay Away from Tall Objects: Don't stand under tall trees, telephone poles, or other elevated objects that lightning is more likely to strike.</li>
<li>Avoid Open Areas: Stay away from open spaces like parks, beaches, golf courses, and swimming pools.</li>
<li>Don't Lie Down: Don't lie flat on the ground. If you must take cover outdoors, crouch low on the balls of your feet with your hands tucked between your knees.</li>
<li>Water: Stay away from bodies of water, including lakes, rivers, and pools. Lightning can travel through water.</li>
<li>Discounted Golf: Contrary to the myth, avoid using golf clubs during a storm. They are tall conductors and can attract lightning strikes.</li>
<h2>Indoors:</h2>
<h4><ul><li>Stay Off Corded Electronics: Avoid using corded phones, computers, or appliances during a thunderstorm. Lightning can travel through electrical wiring.</li>
<li>Avoid Plumbing: Don't take a shower, bath, wash dishes, or do laundry during a storm. Plumbing can conduct electricity.</li>
<li>Stay Away from Windows and Doors: Lightning can strike near windows and doors. Avoid leaning on them or standing close by.</li></ul></h4>
<h2>General Safety Tips:</h2>

<h4><ul><li>Monitor the Weather: Stay informed about weather forecasts and warnings for thunderstorms.</li>
<li>Postpone Outdoor Activities: If possible, reschedule outdoor activities for days with no thunderstorms predicted.</li>
<li>Unplug Electronics: Consider unplugging electronics from power outlets if there's a high risk of lightning strikes in your area.</li>
<li>Surge Protectors: Using surge protectors for valuable electronics can provide some additional protection from lightning strikes.</li></ul></h4>
