    <div><h1>Cyclone Precautions and Safety: Be Prepared, Be Aware</h1>
       <h2> Before a Cyclone:</h2>
        <h4><ul> <li> Pay attention to weather reports and warnings issued by official sources. Sign up for emergency alerts in your area.</li>
        <li>Prepare your home: Trim trees and remove loose objects from around your house that could become projectiles in high winds. Board up windows with plywood or secure them with storm shutters.</li>
       <li> Assemble an emergency kit: This should include non-perishable food, water, a first-aid kit, medications, flashlights, batteries, a battery-powered radio, sanitation supplies, and important documents.</li></ul></h4>
    
      <h2>During a Cyclone:</h2>
       <h4><ul><li> Evacuate if instructed: If you are ordered to evacuate, do so immediately. Don't delay and risk getting trapped by flooding or debris.</li>
        <li>Take shelter: If you cannot evacuate, go to a designated storm shelter or the most interior room in your house, preferably a basement, away from windows and doors.</li>
        <li>Stay informed: Continue to listen to weather updates on a battery-powered radio for the latest information and instructions.</li></ul></h4>
       <h2> After a Cyclone:</h2>
       <h4><ul><li>Stay indoors: Wait for an official "all-clear" before going outside.</li>
        <li>Beware of hazards: Watch out for downed power lines, damaged buildings, and flooding. Do not enter floodwaters which may be contaminated or hiding debris.</li>
        <li>Check on neighbors: Help those who may be injured or need assistance.</li>
        <li>Report damage: Contact your local authorities to report any damage to your property.</li></ul></h4>
